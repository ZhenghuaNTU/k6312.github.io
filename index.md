# K6312 INFORMATION MINING & ANALYSIS

#### <center>NTU, WKW / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='Red'>Course Description </font>

Nowadays, with the popularity of the Internet, there is a massive amount of data available, and it becomes an important resource for mining useful knowledge. From a business and government point of view, there is an increasing need to interpret and act upon the large-volume data.

This course is an introduction to data (or information) mining and analysis, and covers how to analyse structured data. Students will learn various machine learning (or statistical learning) techniques and tools both through lectures and hands-on exercises in labs.
Students will learn following topics in the course:

* Principles and concepts of text and web mining.
* Various machine learning techniques: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree induction, K-Nearest Neighbors classification, Bayesian learning, support vector machines, K-means clustering, etc.
* Evaluation metrics and methods, such as precision, recall, F-1 score, and cross-validation.
* Practical use of data mining to real world applications.

### Course Objectives:

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Appreciate the basics of data mining and analysis.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different data mining techniques.
- Work on practical problems that can be solved using data mining techniques.

### Prerequisites:

- The student has some aptitude for low-level logical thinking since lectures and labs will focus
on technical aspects of Data Mining and Analysis.

Basic computer programming skill is required before you take this course. Also it would be helpful if you have some basic knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

### Method of Assessment:
Coursework (individual and group assignments): 40% (40 marks)
Class Participation (class interactions and attendance): 10% (10 marks)
Final examination: 50% (50 marks); 3 hours closed book exam

### Reference Books

The following books are helpful, but not required. You will easily get these books from Internet.


- Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. (2017), 7th printing 2017 edition, Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. Springer.
- Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python : With Application to Understanding Data *John V. Guttag* 

If you are not proficient in python, you may find [some tutorials](material/coding.md) helpful.

### Individual Homework and Lab Assignments (10 marks)
Due date: will be announced later on

These are individual homework and lab assignments. For the lab assignments, you will be asked to submit simple lab reports during or after certain lab sessions. Note that homework and lab assignment reports handed in after the due date/time will not be marked. These assignments will account for **10%** of the overall grade.

### Group Project (30 marks)
Project title selection due: see the class schedule
Project due date: see the class schedule

This is a group project (the size of each group will be announced later). All team members will receive the same grade. This project will account for **30%** of the overall grade. **Please e-mail the lecturer your project title by the project title selection due date.** Include the names of team members in the message.

This is a data mining project where you collect your own sample dataset or use an existing dataset, and using data mining techniques and tools, build an interesting model that mines and analyzes knowledge/information from the dataset. Generally, the project scope is entirely up to you, but I suggest that you build a useful and interesting model (or application). Then, write a project report explaining your methodology and presenting the results.

You may conduct investigative analysis of your dataset using one or more of the following data mining approaches:

  * Regression (i.e. score prediction)
  * Classification
  * Culstering

The report should contain **up to 3,000 words**. The report **must** include a bibliography listing all references (including URLs, if any) cited, as well as a cover page. The report must be in **both** hard copy and soft copy form and handed in by the due date. The soft copy should be submitted through **Turnitin**. Also submit a CD containing the report, dataset, implementation files (such as Python scripts files), and computer codes (if applicable) used by the project to the instructor by the due date. You are encouraged to produce high quality work as all the reports will be made available on the course web site for the benefit of the class.

For each project, each team will conduct a 15/20-minute presentation on their project work. This will be followed by a 5 minute question-and-answer session to allow for clarification by students and the lecturer. Schedules for the presentation will be announced later.

The assignment is due at the beginning of the class period on due date. Note that reports and required files / documents handed in after the due date will be marked down by **10% per day**.

### Final Exam (50%)

We will prepare a review session before the final exam.
