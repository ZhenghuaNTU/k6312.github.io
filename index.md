# K6312 INFORMATION MINING & ANALYSIS

#### <center>NTU, WKW / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='Red'>Course Description </font>

Nowadays, with the popularity of the Internet, there is a massive amount of data available, and it becomes an important resource for mining useful knowledge. From a business and government point of view, there is an increasing need to interpret and act upon the large-volume data.

This course is an introduction to data (or information) mining and analysis, and covers how to analyse structured data. Students will learn various machine learning (or statistical learning) techniques and tools both through lectures and hands-on exercises in labs.
Students will learn following topics in the course:

* Principles and concepts of text and web mining.
* Various machine learning techniques: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree induction, K-Nearest Neighbors classification, Bayesian learning, support vector machines, K-means clustering, etc.
* Evaluation metrics and methods, such as precision, recall, F-1 score, and cross-validation.
* Practical use of data mining to real world applications.

### Course Objectives:

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Appreciate the basics of data mining and analysis.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different data mining techniques.
- Work on practical problems that can be solved using data mining techniques.

### Prerequisites:

- The student has some aptitude for low-level logical thinking since lectures and labs will focus
on technical aspects of Data Mining and Analysis.

Basic computer programming skill is required before you take this course. Also it would be helpful if you have some basic knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

### Method of Assessment:
Coursework (individual and group assignments): 40% (40 marks)
Class Participation (class interactions and attendance): 10% (10 marks)
Final examination: 50% (50 marks); 3 hours closed book exam

### Reference Books

The following books are helpful, but not required. You will easily get these books from Internet.


- Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. (2017), 7th printing 2017 edition, Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. Springer.
- Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python : With Application to Understanding Data *John V. Guttag* 

If you are not proficient in python, you may find [some tutorials](material/coding.md) helpful.

### Individual Homework and Lab Assignments (10 marks)
Due date: will be announced later on

These are individual homework and lab assignments. For the lab assignments, you will be asked to submit simple lab reports during or after certain lab sessions. Note that homework and lab assignment reports handed in after the due date/time will not be marked. These assignments will account for **10%** of the overall grade.

### Group Project (30 marks)
Project title selection due: see the class schedule
Project due date: see the class schedule

This is a group project (the size of each group will be announced later). All team members will receive the same grade. This project will account for **30%** of the overall grade. **Please e-mail the lecturer your project title by the project title selection due date.** Include the names of team members in the message.

This is a data mining project where you collect your own sample dataset or use an existing dataset, and using data mining techniques and tools, build an interesting model that mines and analyzes knowledge/information from the dataset. Generally, the project scope is entirely up to you, but I suggest that you build a useful and interesting model (or application). Then, write a project report explaining your methodology and presenting the results.

You may conduct investigative analysis of your dataset using one or more of the following data mining approaches:

  * Regression (i.e. score prediction)
  * Classification
  * Culstering

1. Report Submission: 
  - Must include a bibliography listing all references (including URLs, if any) cited
  - Length: 8-10 pages.
  - Formatting: The use of 10-point Times font is mandatory. The formatting should be referred to [ICML style](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/StyleAuthorInstructions). The word template could be found [here](icml2012.doc). The latex template is provided in the [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml-2019-submission-template/vkqjjvzjvhdc). 
  - Only require the soft copy. The soft copy should be submitted through **Turnitin**. 
  - Create your github project page that containing dataset and code used by the project. And put your github repo link in your report.

2. Group Presentation: 
  - Each team will be asked to conduct a 15/20-minute presentation on their project work. This will be followed by a 5 minute question-and-answer session to allow for clarification by students and the lecturer. Schedules for the presentation will be announced later.
  - Every teammember is required to present.

Note that reports and required files/documents handed in after the due date will be marked down by **10% per day**.
